# Screen state matrix

**One authoritative table per screen listing every state that must be built.**
Derived from the kit shots (`docs/design/MemoX Design System/ui_kits/memox-app/shots/`
— filenames encode `<screen>--<state>--<theme>.png`) cross-checked against the
per-screen specs and the business rules. Each Phase-S task (`S.01`…`S.21`) builds
**exactly** the rows for its screen — no happy-path-only screens.

> `S.22 account-sync` is **deferred in v1** (D-027); its shots exist but are not
> built. Rows for it are omitted here.

## Canonical state kinds

Every row is tagged with one kind. A screen only lists the kinds it actually has.

| Kind | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `loading` | data is being fetched (skeletons / spinner). |
| `empty` | no content yet — a first-run/empty-collection `MxEmptyState`. |
| `filtered-empty` | a query/scope returned nothing (distinct copy from `empty`). |
| `error` | load failed — a retryable error surface (`Failure` → `AsyncValue.error`). |
| `success` | the normal loaded content. |
| `partial` | loaded but a sub-state changes the render (goal met, streak reset…). |
| `overlay` | a menu / sheet / picker / dropdown over the screen. |
| `destructive` | a confirm dialog for a data-loss action (`showMxConfirmDialog`). |
| `validation` | inline field validation / soft-duplicate warning. |
| `persistence` | a save/finalize in-flight or its failure (retry surface). |
| `interaction` | a transient in-activity state (selected / correct / wrong / revealed…). |
| `nav` | a state whose purpose is to route elsewhere. |

**Rule:** the state's copy + error messages come from ARB; every error state is
both surfaced to the user (localized) **and** logged. Cite the `D-xxx` a state
enforces so the screen's tests cover it.

## Gaps / notes

- `S.22 account-sync` shots exist (`signed-out/signed-in/syncing/offline/conflict`)
  but the feature is **deferred (D-027)** — not built in v1.
- Overlay/menu states (`*-menu`, `*-picker`, `*-dropdown`, `*-sheet`) reuse the
  shared `MxSheet` / `showMxConfirmDialog` / menu composites; each screen wires its
  own copy from ARB.
- Every `error` / `*-save-error` / `*-error` row must route a `Failure` →
  `AsyncValue.error` to a localized retry surface **and** log it (AGENTS.md error
  contract) — this is the "local-persistence (save/load)" column of the brief.
